## My Journey

Throughout my career, I've worked on a diverse range of projects—from lightweight web APIs to enterprise-scale Optimizely CMS solutions serving tens of thousands of concurrent users, and massive SaaS platforms managing thousands of client instances simultaneously. Each project has taught me that great software isn't just about writing code; it's about solving real problems with elegant, maintainable solutions.

## Technical Expertise

As a **.NET specialist**, I bring deep expertise in the Microsoft technology stack, with a particular focus on building robust, scalable applications. My .NET proficiency spans:

- **ASP.NET Core & .NET 8+** - Building modern, high-performance web applications and APIs
- **C# Advanced Features** - Leveraging async/await, LINQ, generics, and latest language features for clean, efficient code
- **Entity Framework Core** - Designing and optimizing data access layers for enterprise applications
- **Performance Optimization** - SQL Server tuning, caching strategies, and application profiling
- **Architecture Patterns** - SOLID principles, design patterns, and clean architecture implementation

## What I Do

I specialize in:

- **Optimizely CMS & Commerce** - Building scalable, performant digital experience platforms on the .NET stack
- **Database Performance** - Optimizing SQL Server and Entity Framework for high-traffic applications
- **Code Quality** - Championing best practices, clean architecture, and SOLID principles in .NET development
- **Developer Experience** - Creating tools and processes that make teams more productive
- **API Development** - Designing RESTful APIs and microservices with ASP.NET Core

## Community Contributions

As an **Optimizely MVP**, I actively contribute to the developer community through:

- Technical blog posts sharing real-world solutions and .NET best practices
- Open-source contributions and tools
- Helping fellow developers in forums and discussion groups
- Speaking at developer meetups and sharing knowledge

## My Philosophy

I'm passionate about delivering high-quality software designed to serve its purpose. Quality isn't just a buzzword for me—I actively work with tools like SonarQube and implement automated testing to ensure every line of code meets professional standards. I believe in continuous improvement, both in code and in process.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to the Optimizely community, and finding ways to automate the tedious parts of development so we can focus on what really matters: building great software.
